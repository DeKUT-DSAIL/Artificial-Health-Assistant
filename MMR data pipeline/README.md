# MMR Data Collection Pipeline
This repository holds code used to stream sensor data from a [MetaMotionR](https://mbientlab.com/store/metamotionr/). It streams accelorometer and gyroscope sensor data and commits it to an Azure blob storage

## Requirements
- Python API
- Virtual Environment
- Project Packages 
- Connection string to Azure Blob Storage

## 1. Python API

- Make sure The python API is set up correctly.
    1. Linux [API Installation](https://mbientlab.com/tutorials/PyLinux.html)
    2. Windows [API Installation](https://mbientlab.com/tutorials/PyWindows.html)

## 2. Python Virtual Environment
To learn how to install and create a virtul environment check out:
<br> https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/

## 3. Project Packages
To install required packages, run the following command after creating a virtual env.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 4. Connection String
- Before continuing, you need to have the connection string to the blob storage from the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal), [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-powershell) or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-cli)
- To set up an Azure Blob Storage account and get a brief walk though of using blob storage you can check out this repo: https://github.com/makenasandra/azure_blob_storage


Run the following in a terminal

- Unix

```
$ export CONN_STR=pastethereallyreallylongconnectionstringhere
```
- Windows
```
$ set CONN_STR=pastethereallyreallylongconnectionstringhere
```

## Usage
- Turn on bluetooth.

- Run the following and choose an option for an exercise
```
python main.py
```
The script ```main.py``` does the following:
 + Discovers and connects to MMR sensor
 + Streams data based on time entered
 + Uploads data in form of CSV files to the Azure Blob Storage

When you run it in the terminal it will look like this:
```
Discovering nearby Bluetooth Low Energy devices...
[1] - CE:BA:F1:04:7C:D2: MetaWear
[2] - F9:E1:CD:70:81:0C:
Which device do you want to connect to? 1


Choose a number for an exercise below
    1. Standing
    2. Walking
    3. Sitting
    4. Laying Down
    3

Enter Seconds You'll do sitting:

sitting_2021-02-20T10.09.01_gyroscope.csv uploaded successfully!
```
Then you can choose to continue or Exit the program
```
Continue or exit
1. Repeat
2. Exit

```


### Challenges you may face
1. The device fails to conncet or program fails to detect MeteWaer Device 
    + Try rerunning the program. If it fails to connect after rerunning atleast 5 times then there could be another problem
3. The bluetooth may disconnect as the program is running. Just hit ```ctrl + C``` to stop program and restart again.
4. Device collecting way less data than expected or no data at all:  
    + Exit program
    + Ensure the MetaWear Device is the only bluetooth device connected, disconnect any other buletooth devices conected to your laptop.
    + Update the Metawear firmware if there is an update available
    + Run program again


## Querying data
To query data you can create a notebook or just run along with a script
